## Interests and Motivation

I'm a psychology major strongly interested in human evolution, particularly the interactions of culture and genetic evolution, which I believe have led to some of the most distinctive features of human psychologies. This interest has driven me to study a range of interesting subjects in addition to psychology, such as **Prehistory & Archaeology**, **Cultural Anthropology**, **Linguistics**, **Genetics**, **Ecology** and **Evolution**. This interest has also given me an insight about the importance of transmitting idea, knowledge, and experience to others in human societies. 

## Posts

This is a place where I share my notes and some personal experience on learning. You can read my post, [Why Start a Blog?](https://liao961120.github.io/2017/11/26/why-start-a-blog), to have a better understanding of  my incentive.

Some of the posts might not be complete and might not be readable since they are just quick drafts, which I didn't have time to turn them into complete posts. These posts might be helpful, however, if you already gained some idea hinted by the post title.


## Language

Some of the posts were written in Chinese, and some in English since many of my notes were originally taken in English. Some posts might be written in both Chinese and English if I have enough time to do so. Note however that I'm not a native speaker of English, so please bear with the grammatical errors if you encountered some.

## Credits & Acknowledgment

#### **Theme Template**

The theme of my blog is forked from [kitian616/jekyll TeXt theme](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme), and some customization has been done to fit my own tastes. **TeXt theme** is by far the prettiest theme I've ever seen, the typeface and clean layout make it comfortable when reading the blog.

#### **Icon**

The favicon on the browser's tab and the icon beside the site's title are [Tux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux), the official brand character of the Linux kernel. **Tux** is used here because of its cuteness. The version of this Tux is [Tux Crystal 2nd revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux#/media/File:TUX_G2.svg){:target="_blank"}.
